How To Motivate Students Using Videos
Forty years ago using a video was a novelty in the classroom and this in itself was motivational to students as it was perceived, almost, as a treat – an excitement that served as motivation for the lesson! Video may no longer be such a novelty but it can still be used to motivate students in the classroom.                   

A study, conducted recently, examined the effect of video material when used to motivate students. It became clear that the use of videos (even low-cost self-produced videos) can have a vast, positive effect on students’ motivation to learn. This derives from the following:

– Videos capture students’ interest.

– Videos complement theoretical concepts covered in class.

– Videos can be watched again and again and so prepare students better.

– Videos provide an alternative simple-and-fast way of explaining (as opposed to pages of text to work through). 

– Videos provide students with clear direction.

– Videos show preparatory effort on the part of the teacher which, in turn, inspires students.

It is, however, not only content-specific material that can be used to motivate students to work hard in a specific subject. Here are a few more video-ideas that can be used in the classroom to motivate students:
